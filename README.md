# 🐺 CaptureWolf 🐺

Welcome to CaptureWolf, your ultimate solution for catching those sneaky wolves attempting to access your PC when you're away.

## 🎯 What is CaptureWolf?

CaptureWolf is an innovative application crafted to safeguard your PC from unauthorized access. It creates a deceptive impression that your PC is unlocked, enticing potential intruders. However, when they attempt to breach security, CaptureWolf swiftly takes action!

## 🚀 How does it work?

Simply activate CaptureWolf before stepping away from your PC. It will minimize all active windows, presenting the illusion of accessibility.

Here's the twist: at the first sign of any input, whether keystrokes or mouse movement, CaptureWolf instantly locks your PC and captures a snapshot from your webcam, exposing the unsuspecting intruder! 📸

## 🎁 Installation

Installing CaptureWolf is straightforward:

1. Head to the [latest release](https://github.com/galadril/CaptureWolf/releases/latest).
2. Download the installer for your operating system (MacOS or Windows).
3. Execute the downloaded installer.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to finalize setup.
