# CaptureWolf
Make it look like your pc is unlocked to lure in the wolves.

You can use this tool on Windows when your leaving your pc. Just run the CaptureWolf.exe :wolf: and start the tool by typing 'Y'.
It automatically minimizes all your windows, and your pc is then ready to lure in the wolves.

When the tool signals any input (keys/mouse) it locks your pc right away and takes a snapshot from your webcam to 'capture the wolf' that tried to sheep you :wink:


Sheep stick together!! :sheep::sheep::sheep::sheep::sheep:


It currently only works for Windows, but if somebody likes to also port it for MacOS.. send me a PR!!
