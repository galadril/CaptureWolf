Welcome to CaptureWolf, the ultimate tool for catching those sneaky wolves who try to access your PC when you're away. 

## 🎯 What is CaptureWolf?

CaptureWolf is a clever application designed to protect your PC from unauthorized access. It creates an illusion that your PC is unlocked, luring in the wolves. But when they try to access it, CaptureWolf springs into action!

## 🚀 How does it work?

When you're about to leave your PC, simply run CaptureWolf and start the tool. CaptureWolf will then minimize all your windows, making your PC appear as if it's ready for use.

But here's the catch: the moment any input is detected (be it keys or mouse), CaptureWolf locks your PC instantly and takes a snapshot from your webcam, capturing the unsuspecting wolf! 📸

## 🎁 Choose Your Version

CaptureWolf comes in two flavors:

1. **Console Version**: For those who prefer a minimalist, command-line interface. Just run the CaptureWolfConsole.exe file.

2. **UI Version**: For those who prefer a graphical user interface. Run the CaptureWolfUI.exe file, or use the installer to set it up.

## 🐑 Sheep stick together!

We believe in the power of community. CaptureWolf currently only works for Windows, but if you'd like to port it for MacOS, we'd love to see your PR!

## 📥 Installation

CaptureWolf is easy to install. Just follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the GitHub repository.
2. Choose your preferred version: Console or UI. (seperate .exe files)
3. Run the corresponding .exe file, or use the installer for the UI version.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.
